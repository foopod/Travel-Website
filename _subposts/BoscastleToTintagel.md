<h4>5 miles from Boscastle to Tintagel</h4>

Today's walk was a lot more effort that the flat rolling plain that is Dartmoor but the views were well worth it. I can see why this is one of the most popular walks of the year. 
We were dropped at Boscastle in the morning and spent the day scaling and descending the cliffs of the Cornish Coast as we walked towards Tintagel.
We saw amazing views of the seas, which reminded me of home, beautiful outcrops and wild ponies. There was a nerve wracking group photo along the cliff at lunch.
We made some new friends and hopefully we have many more walks with them to look forward to.
The day ended at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/tintagel-castle/">Tintagel</a> which is supposedly the Castle of Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table, and in the cliffs below the castle is Merlin's cave.
Bizarre to be in this place of both history and legend, I am starting to understand why so many History Majors are a part of OODs.

<h4>First day of our family beach holiday!</h4>

After trying Weymouth this morning (it was a bit too cold for our poor Kiwi souls) we headed to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visit-dorset.com/things-to-do/lulworth-cove-p807263">Lulworth Cove</a> this afternoon where it was much nicer weather! We even got to see <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visit-dorset.com/things-to-do/durdle-door-p1262763">Durdle Door</a>, which is a natural formation in the rock caused by the limestone wearing down. If you stand on the clifftops and look along the coast you can see many pillars just off the coast from the cliffs that once would have been like Durdle Door before it completely wore through and collapsed.
The Jurassic Coast is an extremely beautiful part of the UK, and the rock formations are amazing, it reminds me a bit of NZ.

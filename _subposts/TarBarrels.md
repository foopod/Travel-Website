<h4>Bonfires, Mulled Cider, and burning Barrels of Tar</h4>

It is our first Bonfire Night (or Guy Fawkes) in the UK and we are off (along with every other student in Exeter) to Ottery St Mary for the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.tarbarrels.co.uk/home/">Tar Barrels</a>.
What is normally a sleepy little town in Devon becomes chaotic for the night as half the population of Exeter crams into the streets, and if that didn't make it manic enough there are also people carrying flaming barrel of tar in relay races through the town. 
It was cool to have an Autumn Guy Fawkes night for once. Back in New Zealand it takes a long time to get dark and because it is Spring it is already getting to warm to properly enjoy a bonfire or mulled wine (or cider if you are in the west country).
It all seemed a bit bizzare to me but I am going to chalk this up to wierd English traditions like chasing cheese down a hill. 
That being said we had an awesome night, and hopefully will come back again some day to enjoy the spectacle all over agin.

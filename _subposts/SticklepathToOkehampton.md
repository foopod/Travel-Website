<h4>7.5 Miles from Sticklepath to Okehampton</h4>

Today we walked the 7.5 miles from Sticklepath to Okehampton, through Dartmoor. It felt like a proper English Autumn day, a bit of the chilly side with all the leaves starting to turn.
We came across a massive pile of rocks that of course we all had to climb (some of us less willingly than others), the views at the top over Dartmoor were amazing. 
We could see the army running drills and the smoke from them on the moor. 
We ended up in Okehampton in the evening and after waiting for ages for the Grey Hound couch to show up, we just got on the next bus back to Exeter.

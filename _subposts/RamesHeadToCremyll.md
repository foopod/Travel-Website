<h4> 8 miles from Rames Head to Cremyll </h4>

Today was our second walk along the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cornwallinfocus.co.uk/walking/kingsand.php">Cornish Coastline</a>, but the Southern Coast this time. Today was a bit more like the weather I have been expecting for an English Autumn, wet and windy.
We still had a wonderful time though, we had lunch in old caves in the cliffs, got to know everyone a bit better, saw an acient abandoned church and got to walk through the pristene gardens of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visitcornwall.com/things-to-do/attractions/south-coast/cawsand/mount-edgcumbe-house-and-country-park">Mount Edgcumbe Country Park</a>. We also got to walk through the quaint we town of Devonport, the English version is not so different from ours both cute little towns on the coast.
OODs is definitely a great way to meet wonderful people and see the most of the gorgeous countryside we find ourselves living in.

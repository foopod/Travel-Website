<h1>23/11/2013 - Our best, and longest, walk yet</h1>
<h4>10 Miles from Feniton to Wimple</h4>

Today we caught the train from Exeter St David's to Honiton Station and then walked the 10 miles from Feniton to Wimple. 
It was a beautiful day for a walk, sunny and just cool enough to be comfortable. We were joined by Gaby (from our flat) and Louise (our new English bestie).
The walk is a nice flat walk (except for the hill at the end) across farmland and along some very lovely streams and rivers. 
Our new stash arrived today as well so everyone was in their new OODs get up.

<h4>20/08/2017: Beach Day</h4>

We left the beautifully sunny Salisbury to arrive at Weymouth Bay to wind, rain and clouds. We quickly wrapped up in more layers than what we had been wearing on the beach in Auckland in the middle of winter only a couple of days ago. 
Was so good to see the family though, the kids have grown so much in the couple of years since we'd seen them last! We had an awesome day playing with them at the beach!

<h4>19/08/2017: Late night shenanigans as the jetlag takes hold</h4>

We have made it to the UK!

After 30 hours in transit from New Zealand to England via Singapore we have made it to Salisbury to stay with our friend Louise for the night before we head further down the coast. The flight was fairly stress free, if a little boring, and picking up the car from Avis rentals went very smoothly. The drive down to Salisbury from Heathrow was easy, once we got on the M25 and figured out all the different speed limits. It was a beautiful day to arrive in the UK, the sun was shining and was lovely and warm after coming from a New Zealand winter. 

We arrived at Louise's and walked down to the service station to buy some dinner before showers and a nap while we waited for Louise and Jess to return home from a friends wedding. The nap was much needed as we ended up chatting well into the night, catching up on 2 years worth of news and gossip. 

The next morning we headed down into Salisbury township for brunch and a walk around the Cathedral. Finally got to see the Magna Carta, which you expect to be bigger than it is but still pretty cool to see.

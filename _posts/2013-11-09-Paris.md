<h4>Day One: 09/11/2013</h4>

We are in Paris for the weekend! The weekend! Do you know how bizarre it is, when you are from somewhere like New Zealand, to go to another country just for a weekend?

We caught the first train from Exeter on Saturday morning, and after a bit of panic when we were delayed in Reading (I swear we get delayed here every time we go through), and then our tube from Paddignton to St Pancras broke down, we arrived at the Eurostar ready to head to France!
We were supposed to be staying in a hostel near Sacre Coeur, but they double booked us so we ended up in an appartment of a sister hostel down the road. Which sounded fine until we got there. It was a freezing cold room with a fold down couch instead of a bed and no hot water (which we discovered in the morning when trying to have a shower).
But it was secure and it was only for one night. 

After heading straight to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sacre-coeur-montmartre.com/english/">Sacre Coeur</a>, we walked straight in as it was raining and not many people felt like walking up, we had some dinner and were off to the rugby!
We managed to be seated with a bunch of ex pat Kiwis living in London, one of whom was there with a French friend so we got translation of the commentary.
The vibe of the stadium was fantastic, everyone was getting so into it. We learnt that the French Fans sing the National Anthem both when they are cheering and booing, its surprising how different it can sound when its the same song.
New Zealand won (of course) but on a bit of a controversial try so we didnt wave our flag around as the locals were a bit upset. 
We made it back to the freezing appartment and tried to get some sleep before our big day in Paris on Sunday.

<h4>Day Two: 10/11/2013</h4>

Today we walked until we could walk no further!

We were up at the crack of dawn, quickly ate some of the breakfast provided by the hostel, and then were on the move. Louise had read that a near by park to where we were staying gave great views over Paris.
Either we had the wrong park, or it did not. Either way we did not see any views so caught the Metro down to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.notredamedeparis.fr/en/">Notre Dame</a> where once again we walked straight inside.

We had arrived just after Sunday mass so the tourists hadn't had a chance to gather yet. From there we walked to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.french-gardens.com/gardens/jardindeluxembourg.php">Jardin de Luxembourg</a> via the Lock Bridge (Ponts des Arts).
Unfortunately the locks have since been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cometoparis.com/paris-guide/paris-monuments/pont-des-arts-s959">removed</a> but at least we have a photo of the time that ours spent nestled amongst the others. 
The Jardin De Luxembourg was beautiful and well worth a visit no matter what season you are visiting Paris in.
Next stop was the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paris-pantheon.fr/en/">Pantheon</a>, where we got in for free because we had EU passports. 
The Pantheon is very impressive, and very quiet, if you are looking for some peace while out for a day in Paris. 

After a quick stop for coffee we were on the home stretch back to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurostar.com/rw-en/travel-info/stations/paris-gare-du-nord">Gare Du Nord</a>. A quick stop via the Louvre (we didnt go inside but walked around the fountains outside and went to look at the inverted pyramid at the entrance), 
before walking up the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.parisinfo.com/transport/73130/Avenue-des-Champs-Elysees">Champs-élysées</a> to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arcdetriompheparis.com/">Arc De Triomphe</a> (which is a way longer walk than you think it would be when you are looking at it).

Then it was time to head back to England! We got to Paddington just fine, only to find the our train to Exeter had been delayed (at Reading again) for several hours.
We finally got home at 2am and were absolutely shattered! Unsurprisingly we both skipped uni the next day.

But what an awesome weekend! Can't wait to do it again!

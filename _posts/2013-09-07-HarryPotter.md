<h4>This is better than Disneyland!</h4>

If Disneyland is the happiest place on earth then <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wbstudiotour.co.uk/home">Harry Potter Studios Tour</a> is the most magical!
Louise and I had the most amazing day seeing all the set, learning duelling poses, riding on Hagrid's Motorbike, and walking around Hogwarts. Mum was exrtremely patient, and even appeared to be having a good time when she thought we weren't looking. Though she did not take quite as many photos as Louise and I did, nor spend quite as much money in the gift shop!

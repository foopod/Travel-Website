<h4>Our first English County Fair!</h4>

Our first day of family holiday down in Dorset! We headed to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stockgaylard.com/the-oak-fair.asp">Oak Fair</a> near Sturminster Newton and finally got to catch up with Andy and Tina and meet the kids for the first time.
There were owls, tractors, tea, a blow up pub and rain.It all felt like a proper welcome to an English summer holiday!

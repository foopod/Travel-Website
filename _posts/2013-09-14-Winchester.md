<h4>Our last days of Holiday</h4>

Its our last days of freedom before Mum drops us in our new home, Exeter, and returns to New Zealand. 
We are staying with her friends new Winchester for a couple of nights on the way down. They live in a cute little town, in a cute little thatch cottage that is older than New Zealand!
We had a very relaxing couple of days visiting the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.winchester-cathedral.org.uk/">Winchester Cathedral</a> and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jane-austens-house-museum.org.uk/visit-us">Jane Austen House</a>. It is all very quaint and feels very British.
The Jane Austen House is well worth a visit as it is a good representation of life back in those times and is a interesting in sight into the life that she led and the characters that she wrote about.

<h4>Being blown away (literally) at Chesil Beach</h4>

Our birthday weekend kicked off with a night at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oldfirehouseexeter.co.uk/">Old Firehouse Pub</a> in Exeter (the pub that J.K.Rolling based the Leaky Cauldron off according to popular belief).
We spent the night drinking cider and eating pizza with our new friends for our first ever birthday away from home. 
The next day we took the train to Sherbourne to spend the day with our cousins and Aunty Cathy (who had come down from Epping for the weekend). 
After a breakfast of chocolate birthday cake we went to Weymouth where our present was buying a proper winter jumper (Aunty Cathy had deemed that the clothes we brought with us from NZ were not going to make it through an English winter).
On the way back to the train we stopped at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.visit-dorset.com/things-to-do/chesil-beach-p1306903">Chesil Beach</a> on Portland Point where we were literally and figuratively blown away.
The ocean was amazing but you definitely would not want to swim there!
